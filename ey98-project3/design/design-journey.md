# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.**

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


# Existing Project

**Tell us about the project you'll be using for Project 3.**

## Project (Milestone 1)
> Which project will you add interactivity to enhance the site's functionality?

Project 1


## Audience (Milestone 1)
> Who is your project site's audience?
> This should be the original audience from Project 1 or Project 2.
> You should adjust the audience if necessary. Just make sure you explain your rationale for doing so here.

**INTENDED AUDIENCE:** The intended audience for the website i've created targets recruiters of businesses involved with fashion along with other multi-media artists and models interested in collaborations and/or partnerships. In the community of artists and fashion, many people tend to seek for free or paid collaborations in hopes of meeting new people and collaborating ideas and skillsets for a new project. To analyze which artists some may decide to contact, a personal website like the one I have created serves the sole purpose of providing the vision, developed skills, and all the needed information for the audience to understand who I am, what my work is like, and how to contact me. These are the basic but crucial information a recruiter or collaborating artist will need for any further steps in partnerships or communication. Moreover, specific recruiters of brands and businesses may look for an artist, like me, to assist in the direction, production, and photography for the portrayal of new project. Other artists and models may simply just want photos for their own portfolios as well. Moreover, a website that portrays all my previous works and projects along with brief information regarding myself and my contact information would best target brand recruiters along with models and other artists.

## Audience's Goals (Milestone 1)
> List the audience's goals that you identified in Project 1 or 2.
> Just list each goal. No need to include the "Design Ideas and Choices", etc. You may adjust the goals if necessary. However, any changes you make to the goals for this project should be clearly identified and justified.

- Goal 1: Encourage/impress the audience to fully explore the site and further come in contact.
- Goal 2: Present my works and projects as clearly and visually pleasing to the audience.
- Goal 3: Portray crucial information or content in a clear, concise, and simplistic manner.
- Goal 4: Theme and structure the website to convey the feeling of being in an actual but virtual art gallery.

# Interactivity Design

## Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 1)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- Idea 1: Carousel or Slideshow for the recent works on the home page (possibly clicking on the images will proceed to the next image). This is done to give a nice initial welcoming page portraying my work in a slideshow manner, with the music also playing in the background. I strive to impress and encourage recruiters and other artists being fully immersed into my site so they want to work with me. This goal would be better achieved if interactive aspects like a slideshow on the home page is added.

- Idea 2: Add an index; Digital Clock for the Date, Year, and Time to keep track of the time, fully immersed into the gallery site. This is simply an additional artistic aspect of the site that I personally thought was fit for my site. To avoid a sense of dullness, a digital click to portray the current time, year, and date would be a nice touch and assist in the minimalistic look overall.

- Idea 3: When the email on the bottom is clicked, it automatically directs to an email page. This is done for the sake of convenience and ease of my target audience (recruiters and other artists/models) when trying to contact me for any interested partnership or collaborations.

- Idea 4: MAYBE: A gallery for my WORKS page, as it only makes sense to include this interactive aspect to a page portraying all my selected works and projects. This is done to better give a sequential order when browsing through the collection of my images and files. This would offer a better experience for my target audience when viewing my works as a multi-media artist interested in collaborations and further projects.


## Interactivity Proposal & Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Make a decision about your site's interactivity. Explain what you plan to implement and where it will go on your site.
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity. Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience.

**Interactivity Proposal:** Carousel or Slideshow for the recent works on the home page (possibly clicking on the images will proceed to the next image).

**User Goals Rational:** This is done to give a nice initial welcoming page, portraying my work in a slideshow manner, with the music also playing in the background. It is intended to add on to the art gallery effect striving to impress and encourage recruiters and other artists, fully immersed in my site, further wanting to work with me. This goal would be best achieved if interactive aspects like a slideshow on the home page is added to directly portray proud work.

**Interactivity Proposal:** Add an index; Digital Clock for the Date, Year, and Time to keep track of the time, fully immersed into the gallery site.

**User Goals Rational:** This is simply an additional artistic aspect of the site that I personally thought was fit for my site. To avoid a sense of dullness, a digital click to portray the current time, year, and date would be a nice touch and assist in the minimalistic look overall.

## Interactivity Design Ideation (Milestone 1)
> Now that you've made a decision about the site's interactivity, explore the possible design solutions for the interactivity.
> Sketch several iterations of your interactivity.
> Annotate each sketch explaining what happens when a user takes an action. (e.g. When user clicks this, this happens.)

## Final Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)
> Review your sketches from the previous step and pick your final design.
> Create a _polished_ sketch (it's still a sketch, but with a little more care taken to communicate ideas clearly to the graders) to plan your interactivity.
> **Sketch out the entire page where your interactivity will go.** Add your interactivity to the sketch. Add any annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action.
> Include as many sketches as necessary to communicate your design (ask yourself, could another 1300 take these sketches an implement my design?)

## "Ambitious" Interactivity Explanation
> In your own words, concisely explain why you believe your interactivity meets the "ambitious" requirement.

My chosen interactivity meets the "ambitious requirement", as they not only nicely add on to the physical theme and visual outlook of the entire website, but the code itself range from complex to simple interactive aspects with the audience/user. The somewhat complex and ambitious addition of the slide show on my home page not only nicely adds on to the art gallery theme but also to my goal in portraying my work to encourage partnerships and positive feedback. By directly portraying some of my current and best works, in my home page without greatly disrupting much of the sites structure, the addition of a slideshow is quite fitting and ambitious in this case. The user will be able to click on the next button to proceed to the next image of the slideshow. Its functionality will be presented quite visibly clear and obvious. Additionally, the addition of a possible index/digital clock and automated email direct function is a more simple interactive factor to the site to simply add on to the artistic theme of the site and ease the process of reaching out to me.

## Additional Information (Milestone 1)
> (optional) Include any additional information, justifications, or comments we should be aware of.

The addition of a possible index is quite random and not as relevant compared to the other interactive aspects. However, my vision in adding this was that not only would it be a mere easy addition of an interactive code, but its presence can truly and heavily nicely add on to the visual presentation of my entire portfolio site, and would like to first see how it may look if added.

# Grading (Final Submission)

## Interactivity Usability Justification (Final Submission)
> Explain how your design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.

My design effectively uses affordances and visibility as I have themed and designed my website in a way where the users are able to efficiently understand the operation of things through the inclusion of clues on a white canvas, as minimalism is a recurring theme. Interactive aspects such as the slideshow were designed and coded to include easy and clear clues to support affordances, as the previous and next buttons left and right clearly indicates its function that when clicked, the page will proceed to the next file in the carousel. Additionally, the menu bar options are also underlined conveying the idea that if clicked on, a new page will be directed. Behind all this is a mere white canvas, the color background for all my pages, intended to assist the visibility of my contents throughout the users browse. Moreover, for feedback, whenever the user does click on any interactive buttons, they will visually notice its function, as the arrows on the slideshow will move to the next image, and any type of hovering on the gallery images will enlarge them on the screen automatically. Additionally, if one clicks on my email, which is present on the bottom of all my pages along with an underline, it will become automatically directed to a send email page on their device. This interactive function also supports feedback as when copied, the desktop device itself will redirect them to their email page. Familiarity is also effectively used through my design, as the slideshow is placed under a title labeled recent works and the image moves on to the next when the user clicks on the button. The gallery is structured in a common manner where it is quite obvious it is a digital art gallery where one may cause an action if an image is hovered or clicked on. This can be done to all the files on the WORKS page, establishing a sense of design pattern in my website.  


## Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. Use it wisely. However, you don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the final submission design journey.

## Tell us What to Grade (Final Submission)
> We aren't re-grading your Project 1 or 2. We are only grading the interactivity you added.
> Tell us where (what page) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed, we won't grade it.

The main and ambitious interactivity I have included in this project, a carousel, may be found in the main home index.html file where my main content would be, along with slideshow.js file where my back end JavaScript code for the interactive carousel may also be found.

## Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> This was the first project in this class where you coded some JavaScript. What did you learn from this experience?

From this experience, I have learned that JavaScript is a bit more different wit HTML and CSS in the sense of its actual functions, but also the perplexity of its code compared to its counterparts. I had initially felt comfortable with the coding style and technique under HTML and CSS until I had confronted JavaScript, which seemed to be a bit more complex, although it was still doable. This complexity also came with its own benefits, as I was really able to expand my ideas and designs and further execute them onto my website. Many actions were quite restricted due to the prohibition of JS in our previous projects, but in project 3, the flexibility and freedom truly helped me understand why HTML, CSS, and JS all work hand to hand to further provide a final product. I learned that I personally enjoy HTML and CSS more for now, but do not expect that mentality and preference to change once I become much more familiarized and used to the JavaScript language. Nonetheless, it was clear that the functionalities and usage of JS in designing a website is extremely crucial and important, as it gives access to interactive functions that are used daily on all kinds of sites.


> Reflect on how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together support client-side interactivity. If it's helpful, you can describe your mental model of client-side interactivity or explain how the general idea of showing and hiding content can be used to implement other forms of client-side interactivity beyond what you've done in this project.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together support client-side interactivity as they are all needed to fully allow function to successfully work. Moreover, one will need to have elements and their respective ids and classes in the HTML file, appropriate selectors in their CSS file, and specific ids and selectors from these files into the JavaScript as well. Moreover, the tags used in HTML is continuously used across CSS and JS to allow visible content hold and execute interactive functions with the program made in JavaScript. A jQuery and Javascript script should also be linked at the bottom of the HTML file to allow the entire interactive function to work. HTML covers most of the visual content of the site where as CSS covers the style and JavaScript covers its interactivity. To allow the visible contents and styles to be responsive to the user, JavaScript is lastly utilized to link the html and css together using tags and selectors, and coding the "behavior" aspect of the website at hand. Moreover, the concept of showing and hiding content is commonly used as scenarios such as a gallery view or in my case, a slideshow, will have certain files hidden while some will not, with the JavaScript code and CSS selectors being used to direct the site when the files should remain hidden and shown as a response to the users action.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!

Prior from taking this course, I had no knowledge of any type of coding language and was vaguely intimidated at first. However, as I reflect upon how much I have grown and learned since starting this course, I am extremely satisfied and glad to have taken a course that have provided life lasting tools and knowledge. I am quite proud and amazed with how much I have learned regarding the usage of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the combination of them all. To be able to not only use each language but also simultaneously link them to create a more complex product is a process that I would have never imagined of doing a year from today. After multiple projects and a current group project, I am excited to see how much more I will learn.
